    <h2>PERSONAL</h2><p>
       This is internal -- She usually used to do meditation before. And yoga also. Otherwise she had a headache all day so sad. But now she will be alright now. And hope this pain never comes again please god.<br>One more She is very very brave girl she used to drink we his father which is a very brave step,  but apart from that she will always daddy's little princess.<br>
        But she doesn't got angry fastam fast but if you can say something which is out of that range then she got angry but she will that polite that after this mistake she forgive that's the best thing about her kindness.<br>The other perspective of her life is her best friends, I don't know much of them but I think they are : Bhupesh, Ishan, Riya, Insha And Janvi. I think of those till I know, only they are her best friends.<br>
        And here is the one whom with she is in relationship with the lucky man "Sawan Rathore". He is so much lucky that no one can't dream of it. He makes her laugh for more than three years and surely more than that. Bhupesh is the paracetamol of this faithful relationship.
